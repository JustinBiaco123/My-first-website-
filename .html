"My Experience on the 1st day of class"
</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;">
My first day in class as a grade 9 student is a little bit surprising. I was excited and nervous at the same time when I woke up, excited, because I will meet my friends again and nervous because of the typical introduce yourself speech. When I was waiting for my service outside, rain suddenly poured from the sky, the rain was strong but it did not last for long, however, I believe that rain is a sign of good luck. When I arrived at school, I met my friends again until the first period came where we get to meet our adviser again. We did have those "introduce yourself" speech and subject orientation as expected. We met our new subject teachers and I hope it will be fun. Overall, my first day of school is a mixed feelings of excitement, surprise and nervousness.
